Workload E:
This workload is to test that malloc can handle many small requests when a large portion is taken by another program. This works by choosing an upper or lower of middle to allocate of the 5000 byte block. Effectively taking 1/3 of the available space. Then randomly allocate and free 3000 times. Making sure to allocate 3000 times before ending. This is important because it tests that our program can allocate memory around a chunk.

Workload F:
This workload tests the free speed by first loading 1250 blocks of 1 which is the max for 5000Bytes. Then it starts freeing from the middle. It then increases the free by + and - 1 each time. So it frees from n/2 then n/2+1 then n/2-1 .... until it reaches 0 and n. This tests that we can correctly combine multiple empty blocks.
